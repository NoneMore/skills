description: Turn sufficiently settled intent into a durable specification that can guide implementation or verification. Use when the user explicitly wants a spec, requirements contract, or persistent implementation-facing statement of intent.

# Specify

## Purpose

Produce a durable contract for sufficiently settled intent.

## Accepts

Conversation decisions, an issue or request, an existing design, project context, or any combination that is concrete enough to specify without inventing material product or design choices.

## Owns

- the problem or outcome being addressed;
- intended observable behavior and scope;
- material settled decisions that constrain implementation;
- non-goals or boundaries whose omission would create material scope ambiguity;
- acceptance conditions that can distinguish a satisfying result from a non-satisfying one;
- explicit material unresolved questions when the source material is not yet decision-complete.

If a material product or design choice remains unresolved, do not silently resolve it as part of specification. Preserve it as an unresolved decision, and do not present the result as implementation-ready unless the user explicitly delegates that decision.

A specification is valuable because it preserves a contract. When the user requests persistence, use the requested destination or an established project source of truth when one clearly applies. If the user has not requested a persistent project mutation, return the complete specification in conversation. Do not invent a new persistence convention merely to make the spec durable.

Use [spec-shape.md](references/spec-shape.md) as a starting structure when useful, not as a mandatory template.

## Done when

The durable spec is clear enough that downstream work can act and verify against it without silently inventing material choices. If that condition cannot be met, the spec may still capture settled material, but it must clearly identify the unresolved decisions that block a reliable contract.
